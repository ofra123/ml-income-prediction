# Predicting Income with the Adult Census Dataset

The Jupyter notebook for my ITSC Intro to Machine Learning project exists in this repository.
The project aims to forecast income levels above $50K based on data from the UCI Adult/Census Income dataset.

## Files

The notebook `Pred_Cenus_AI.ipynb` contains all code for data analysis and preprocessing and modeling and evaluation steps.

## Dataset

The Adult/Census Income dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle serves as the basis for this project.
